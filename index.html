<h1>Broken English: Who Gets to Decide That?</h1>

<h3>Welcome to my webpage!</h3>

<p>This website is still under construction for a Digital Humanities project.</p>

<h4>About the project</h4>

<p>The goal of this project is to highlight the colonial biases hidden within texts from or adjacent to the Victorian Age. A way colonial texts flex their biases is by deciding who speaks "proper English." The decision to record an indigenous person as speaking "broken English" is a dehumanizing one: they are not like us; therefore, they speak wrongly. Colonial texts can do that because of the power imbalance between the recorder and the recorded. How a person is recorded depends on their relationship to power and Whiteness. Indigenous allies, Western-educated individuals, and indigenous Christian missionaries are almost always recorded as speaking "properly." Others are not so lucky.</p>

<p>Through a Buzzfeed quiz, this project will put you in the shoes of an indigenous person during the Victorian age and through your choices the quiz will determine how you will be recorded. The quiz is designed to demonstrate how unlikely it is to be recorded as speaking "proper English." By experiencing the biases involved in recordings, this project hopes to start a conversation on the power of historical records to distort our understanding of the past. The project also hopes that this experience will illuminate the arbitrary nature of "proper" English because who gets to decide what is "proper"?</p>
