<h1>Nameless in the Colonies</h1>

<h3>A <a href="https://onemorevoice.org/index.html"><i>One More Voice</i><a/> companion project </h3>

<h2>About the project</h2>

<p class="aim">The goal of this project is to highlight the colonial biases hidden within texts from or adjacent to the Victorian Age. A way colonial texts flex their biases is by deciding who gets a name. Recording a person without their name is equal to not having recorded them at all, because without a name, readers will never know who is truly behind the voice. This erasure in colonial texts is accompanied by recording an indigenous person as speaking "broken English." he decision to record an indigenous person as speaking "broken English" is a dehumanizing one: they are not like us; therefore, they speak wrongly. Ultimately, colonial texts can do that because of the power imbalance between the recorder and the recorded. How a person is recorded depends on their relationship to power and Whiteness.</p>

<p class="aim">Through a Twine text game where you play the role of an indigenous person during during the Victorian age, the project will show how you will potentially be recorded in a missionary journal. The game will demonstrate how unlikely it is to be recorded with a name while speaking "proper English." By experiencing the biases involved in recordings, this project hopes to start a conversation on the power of historical records to distort our understanding of the past.</p>
